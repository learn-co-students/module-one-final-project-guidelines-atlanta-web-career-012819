# TV Show Ratings - Data Analytics
## Setup
First, run `bundle install` from the root directory to install dependencies. Next run `rake db:migrate` to setup the database tables.

Random data has been generated already and stored for you as JSON in the `db/json` directory. If you would just like to get up and running quickly, simply run `rake db:seed` to seed the database with the supplied data.

Alternatively, you can run `rake generate:all` to generate a new set of random data, and then `rake db:seed` to seed the database.
## Getting Started
* Run `ruby bin/run.rb` to start the program.
* From the main menu, type `help` to list all of the available commands. From the main menu you can get a list of shows and a list of viewers. You can go to the `show` menu to get more data about each show, or go to the `viewer` menu to get more data about each viewer.
