# Cause Connect

Cause Connect is my first Flatiron project in which I generated fake data for potential donors, non-profit organizations(causes) and donations. The "app" idea was to help those looking to contribute to a cause(donors) find causes of interest.

##User Story
  1. Allow users to create a cause [CREATE]
  2. Donors can search for causes (specific or genre) [READ]
  3. Causes' status can be updated, ranking 1-10 where 10 == completion status[UPDATE]
  4. Donors can make a donation (donations must be $100-$999)[CREATE]
  5. Donors can cancel a donation [DELETE]
  6. Users can delete a cause [DELETE]
